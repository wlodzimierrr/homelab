 Homelab Platform Roadmap (Solo Engineer)

## Executive summary

You should build this platform in **small, production-like slices**: establish a secure GitOps foundation first, then ship a thin vertical slice of your app (frontend + backend + DB + auth), then add observability, and finally evolve into self-service workflows. The primary strategy is:

1. **Stabilize the platform control plane** (cluster, ingress, certs, Argo CD, baseline RBAC).
2. **Deliver one end-to-end workload** (React + FastAPI + Postgres + JWT) through GitOps.
3. **Add guardrails and visibility** (secrets management, policy, monitoring, logs, dashboards).
4. **Automate promotion and developer experience** only after baseline reliability is proven.

For a solo homelab, the key anti-pattern to avoid is building internal platform abstractions before you have repeated pain. Start manual-but-documented, then automate the repeated steps.

---

## Recommended implementation order (opinionated)

1. Phase 0: Foundation hardening and repo strategy
2. Phase 1: Minimum secure GitOps + app vertical slice
3. Phase 2: CI/CD image flow and promotion mechanics
4. Phase 3: Security depth and policy enforcement
5. Phase 4: Observability and operational maturity
6. Phase 5: Self-service and multi-environment expansion

## Current-state alignment (based on this repo)

Below is the practical alignment between this roadmap and what appears to already exist in the repository today.

### Already done / materially in place
- **Cluster and networking foundation:** k3s HA install automation, MetalLB, Traefik exposure, and gateway forwarding/WireGuard automation are present.
- **Core platform bootstrap automation:** Argo CD and cert-manager install playbooks/roles exist.
- **Security baseline partially implemented:** Argo CD `admin.enabled=false`, local RBAC defaults, and Argo CD network policy templating are already configured.
- **Infra-as-code for gateway layer:** Terraform for gateway networking/server provisioning exists.

### Partially done (needs completion/validation)
- **Argo CD RBAC hardening:** base policy exists, but project-level boundaries and end-to-end claim mapping still need validation.
- **Network-policy posture:** Argo CD policy exists; app namespace default-deny and explicit allow-lists are not yet represented as a complete standard.
- **Ingress security model:** controls exist in templates/vars, but OAuth/Cloudflare Zero Trust decision and rollout are pending.

### Not yet present (major gaps)
- Application code and manifests for the target platform app (React/FastAPI/Postgres/JWT).
- CI pipelines for build/test/publish + image promotion automation.
- GitOps workloads-repo structure for multi-environment promotion.
- Secrets-as-code workflow (SOPS/Sealed Secrets) and rotation automation.
- Observability stack and runbooks (Prometheus/Grafana/Loki dashboards/alerts).

### Ticket status normalization
Use these tags in tracking:
- **DONE**: implemented in repo and minimally validated.
- **IN PROGRESS**: artifacts exist but missing policy checks/tests/runbook validation.
- **TODO**: no meaningful implementation yet.

Recommended immediate relabeling:
- **DONE:** T1.1.2 (admin disable + baseline RBAC), portions of T0.3.1 (platform namespace policy), and platform install foundations supporting Phase 0.
- **IN PROGRESS:** T3.1.1, T0.3.1 (app namespaces), T1.3.2.
- **TODO:** most of E1.2, all of E2.x, most of E3.2/E3.3, all E4.x and E5.x.

---

## Re-baselined next steps (aligned to what is already done)

1. **Finish Phase 0 closure:** explicitly validate/standardize namespace policies and service-account least privilege.
2. **Accelerate to app vertical slice (E1.2/E1.3):** this is now the highest-value gap.
3. **Immediately follow with CI + image promotion (E2):** avoid manual deployment drift once app exists.
4. **Then complete identity/secrets decisions (E3.2/E3.3):** before opening access broadly.
5. **Add observability (E4) once app traffic exists:** dashboards before portal/self-service.

## ADR candidates (architectural decision points)

1. **ADR: Secrets management approach** (SOPS vs Sealed Secrets vs external secret manager).
2. **ADR: GitOps layout** (single repo vs split repos; environment layering model).
3. **ADR: Manifest tooling** (Kustomize vs Helm-first vs mixed strategy).
4. **ADR: AuthN/AuthZ pattern** (OAuth provider vs Cloudflare Zero Trust; claim mapping).
5. **ADR: Registry standard** (GHCR vs Harbor, retention and vulnerability scanning).
6. **ADR: Observability stack scope** (Loki vs ELK; alerting toolchain depth).
7. **ADR: Promotion model** (auto-dev, gated staging/prod semantics).
8. **ADR: Multi-env branching strategy** (folder-based trunk vs branch-per-env).

---

## Sequencing risks and blockers

### Top blockers
- **Identity integration uncertainty:** Delaying OAuth/ZT decision will stall Argo CD RBAC hardening.
- **Secrets strategy churn:** Migrating from plaintext/adhoc secrets later is painful and risky.
- **GitOps structure indecision:** Reorganizing repo topology midstream creates migration overhead.
- **Over-automation too early:** Building full self-service before stable deploy standards adds rework.

### High-risk sequencing mistakes to avoid
1. Implementing self-service provisioning before deterministic CI/CD and promotion exists.
2. Building multi-env overlays before single-env reliability is proven.
3. Introducing ELK early (resource-heavy) before proving Loki is insufficient.
4. Delaying RBAC and admin disablement until after broad user access is granted.

---

## What NOT to build yet (anti-scope creep)

- Full internal developer portal platform (Backstage-class) before you have >5 services.
- Complex policy engines (OPA/Gatekeeper/Kyverno) until baseline RBAC/network policies are stable.
- Service mesh (Istio/Linkerd) unless you have concrete mTLS/traffic-splitting requirements.
- Multi-cluster federation before one cluster runs reliably for several weeks.
- Custom deployment controllers when Argo CD + Image Updater already solves current needs.

---

## Maturity model (Level 1 → Level 5)

### Level 1: Repeatable manual platform
- Cluster and Argo CD installed.
- App deployed via GitOps manually updated tags.
- Basic ingress auth and backups.

### Level 2: Secure baseline platform
- Argo admin disabled, RBAC enforced.
- JWT auth implemented; service account least privilege applied.
- Secrets encrypted in Git.

### Level 3: Automated delivery platform
- CI builds/tests/publishes immutable images.
- Auto image updates in dev; gated promotion to higher envs.
- Rollback playbook tested.

### Level 4: Observable and operable platform
- Metrics, logs, and release dashboards in place.
- Alerting for key failures.
- Incident/runbook workflows consistently used.

### Level 5: Productized internal platform
- Multi-environment promotion is routine.
- New service bootstrap is semi-self-service.
- Lightweight internal catalog/portal supports discoverability and operations.

---

## Early automation to reduce rework

Prioritize these automations as soon as baseline app deploy works:

1. **Template-driven manifests** (base app chart/overlay skeleton).
2. **CI reusable workflows** (shared build/test/publish jobs).
3. **Automated image bump PRs/commits for dev.**
4. **Secrets encryption/decryption workflow in CI and local tooling.**
5. **One-command environment bootstrap scripts** for new cluster/app namespaces.
6. **Release traceability links** (commit → image → deployment annotation).

These yield compounding benefits and reduce migration pain later.

---

## Suggested timeline (evenings/weekends realistic plan)

Assumption: ~8-12 hours/week.

- **Month 1:** Phase 0 + Phase 1 core (first end-to-end app live through Argo CD).
- **Month 2:** Phase 2 automation (CI, image promotion) + start Phase 3 decisions.
- **Month 3:** Complete Phase 3 security + Phase 4 observability baseline.
- **Month 4+:** Phase 5 only after at least 3-4 weeks of stable operations.

Practical checkpoint rule: do not advance phases unless current phase has at least one "fire drill" (rollback/recovery test) completed successfully.

---

## Architectural evolution diagram (textual)

### Stage A (Foundation)
Developer push → Git (infra/workloads repos) → Argo CD sync → K3s cluster resources.

### Stage B (Vertical slice)
User → Ingress → React frontend → FastAPI backend → PostgreSQL.

### Stage C (Automated delivery)
Developer push → CI build/test → image registry publish → image updater commit/PR → Argo CD sync.

### Stage D (Secure + observable platform)
Identity provider/Cloudflare ZT → ingress and Argo CD auth;
Prometheus/Grafana + Loki ingest telemetry from cluster/app;
Dashboards map deployment state to runtime health.

### Stage E (Platform product)
Project template automation creates repo/manifests/pipelines;
Multi-env promotion workflow governs dev → staging → prod;
Catalog view surfaces ownership, status, and operational links.
